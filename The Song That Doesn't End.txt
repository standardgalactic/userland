The Song That Doesn't End
On Recursive Propagation in Memes, Waves, and Autocatalytic Systems
by Flixion, July 2025.
Abstract
This essay explores the structural commonality
underlying seemingly disparate systems.
Viral memes, electromagnetic waves,
and collectively autocatalytic chemical sets.
Each exhibits self-propagation through internal recursion
or mutual generation.
We argue that such systems constitute a general class
of self-sustaining processes whose continuity is ensured
not by external validation or utility,
but by structural features that favor their own persistence.
This analysis situates memetic survival
within a broader epistemic and physical ontology,
suggesting that language, cognition, and even physical forces
participate in a deeper recursive logic,
extensions to biological, economic, social, and political systems,
along with empirical and philosophical implications,
further illuminate this unifying pattern.
One Introduction
The Infinite Song
The children's tune The Song That Doesn't End
encapsulates a recursive loop.
Each line instructs the singer to continue,
embedding the imperative for perpetuation within its own structure.
Far from a trivial amusement,
this song exemplifies a broader class of systems,
memes, electromagnetic waves,
and autocatalytic chemical sets
that persist through internal recursion or mutual generation.
Language, often described as a cognitive infection
that restructures human thought to propagate itself,
serves as a paradigmatic case.
This essay argues that such systems share a structural logic.
They encode instructions or dynamics
that ensure their own continuity,
independent of external truth or utility.
By examining memetic persistence,
electromagnetic wave propagation,
autocatalytic chemical networks,
and additional domains like biology and economics,
we propose a unified framework for self-propagating systems,
with implications for understanding
language, cognition, and epistemology.
2. Mimetic persistence and the counterfoil stub
In memetics, ideas replicate through culture,
not because they are true or useful,
but because they are replicable.
Memes that endure often possess qualities
such as rhythm, emotional salience,
recursion, or self-reference.
The metaphor of the counterfoil stub,
a receipt saved because it declares,
do not throw this away,
captures this dynamic.
Similarly, the Calabari cultural practice
of offering a counterfoil choice,
e.g. an empty bowl alongside a full one,
highlights a preferred option through contrast.
In memetic terms, seemingly inferior or false ideas,
such as forbidden memes that instruct
don't share this,
may persist by leveraging curiosity,
exclusivity, or social signaling.
These memes thrive not despite their prohibition,
but because it amplifies their allure,
creating a paradox where disobedience
ensures propagation.
For example, phrases like,
I'm not supposed to tell you this,
but embed a transgression engine,
ensuring their spread through violation
of their own instructions.
This suggests that memetic survival
often hinges on structural features,
stickiness, contrast, or provocation,
rather than epistemic validity.
3. Electromagnetic Waves as Recursive Fields
Electromagnetic EM,
radiation as described by Maxwell's equations,
exemplifies mutual recursion in physical systems.
A changing electric field induces a magnetic field,
which in turn induces an electric field,
resulting in a self-propagating wave
that persists through space
without external intervention.
This dynamic mirrors memetic loops.
Once initiated,
the wave structure ensures its continuation,
akin to a meme that regenerates interest
through responses it elicits.
The recursive interplay of electric and magnetic fields
requires no external validation,
much like a viral slogan
that spreads through its own salience.
This analogy highlights a shared logic,
systems that propagate
by generating the conditions
for their own continuity.
4. Autocatalytic Sets and Chemical Cognition
Stuart Kaufman's theory
of collectively autocatalytic sets
describes chemical systems
where molecules catalyze the formation of others
within the same set,
creating a self-sustaining network.
These sets exhibit structural closure,
requiring no external intervention once initiated,
and propagate by creating favorable conditions
for their own persistence.
Proposed as prebiotic precursors to life,
autocatalytic sets share structural parallels
with memetic networks and language,
where ideas or grammatical rules
mutually reinforce each other.
For instance,
a linguistic system sustains itself
through recursive definitions
and syntactic loops,
much like a chemical network
perpetuates through catalytic cycles.
This suggests that cognition itself
may operate as an autocatalytic system,
with ideas persisting through mutual enablement
rather than centralized control.
Here 5. Toward a general theory of self-propagation
The systems discussed memes, EM-waves,
and autocatalytic sets
share four key criteria.
1. Recursive causation
Outputs feed back into inputs,
creating self-reinforcing loops.
2. Mutual generation
Elements produce each other
across structural boundaries,
as in electric and magnetic fields
or catalytic networks.
3. Persistence
Through internal logic,
Continuity depends on structural features,
not external validation.
4. Resistance determination
Attempts to halt these systems
often reinforce their propagation,
as seen in earworms or forbidden memes.
These criteria define a general class
of self-propagating systems,
applicable across cognitive,
physical, and chemical domains.
For example,
the Zettelkasten note-taking system,
with its interconnected entries,
resembles a memetic autocatalytic set,
where ideas persist through recursive linking
rather than inherent truth.
5.1. Formalizing recursive propagation
To formalize this framework,
consider recursive causation
as a dynamical system,
mon d equals un plus dacam,
where worm represents feedback
from prior states,
modeling loops like those
in the song that doesn't end.
Resistance determination
can be quantified
via Lyapunov stability,
where a system's fixed points
have negative eigenvalues,
the A0,
ensuring persistence
against perturbations.
Connections to complexity theory
highlight emergent behavior
in self-organizing systems,
while cybernetics emphasizes
feedback loops,
and systems theory explores
autopoiesis.
These frameworks provide
rigorous metrics
for analyzing self-propagation,
grounding the essay's
conceptual unity
in mathematical
and theoretical terms.
5.2. Empirical approaches
to recursive propagation
empirical validation
of this framework
requires testing
the four criteria.
Experiments could measure
memetic persistence
by comparing structural features,
e.g. rhythm-emotional salience,
against truth value,
using metrics like share rates
or retention time
in social media datasets.
Analysis of viral content
could identify patterns
like recursion or self-reference,
leveraging computational memetics.
Neuroimaging studies
could explore neural correlates
of earworms,
examining how recursive
cognitive loops
activate reward circuits.
These approaches
would test the hypothesis
that structural features
drive propagation
independent of epistemic merit.
6. Additional domains
of recursive propagation.
6.1. Biological systems.
Viruses, prions, and cancer cells
exhibit recursive propagation.
For example,
viral proteins act as
counterfoil stubs,
ensuring replication
by hijacking cellular machinery.
Prions propagate
by inducing misfolding
in other proteins,
a recursive loop
akin to memetic spread.
Cancer cells sustain growth
through autocatalytic
signaling pathways,
mirroring the
mutual generation criterion.
6.2. Economic systems.
Ponzi schemes
and cryptocurrency hype cycles
operate as autocatalytic
financial loops.
In Ponzi schemes,
early payouts
catalyze further investment,
creating a self-reinforcing cycle
until collapse.
Cryptocurrency markets propagate
through speculative feedback
where hype generates more hype,
aligning with the essay's criteria
of mutual generation
and internal persistence.
6.3. Social media algorithms.
Recommendation algorithms
create recursive content loops
by amplifying attention
to salient items,
forming echo chambers
that mirror memetic propagation.
These systems exhibit
resistance to termination
as user engagement
reinforces algorithmic bias,
sustaining loops
without external validation.
6.4. Political movements.
Ideological frameworks,
such as populist narratives,
persist through recursive
reinforcement
and contrastive framing,
e.g. us versus them
as a Calabari counterfoil choice.
These movements propagate
by embedding instructions
for their own continuation,
leveraging emotional salience
and social identity.
7. Philosophical dimensions
of recursive systems.
The recursive framework
raises profound philosophical questions.
The tension between
structural persistence
and epistemic value
challenges traditional notions
of truth-seeking.
If cognition prioritizes
stickiness over validity,
what distinguishes meaningful ideas
from mere earworms?
This suggests a view of cognition
as an autocatalytic arena
where agency competes
with recursive loops,
potentially undermining free will.
Connections to Buddhist
dependent origination
where phenomena co-arise
through mutual causation
and Hindu cyclical time,
samsara,
situate the framework
in global philosophical traditions,
highlighting recursion
as a universal principle
of existence.
7.1. Historical perspectives
on recursive propagation.
Historically,
recursive systems are evident
in persistent cultural practices.
Oral storytelling traditions
embed recursive structures,
e.g. repeated motifs
in epics that ensure transmission
across generations.
Religious dogmas propagate
through self-referential doctrines
akin to counterfoil stubs.
Technological shifts
such as the printing press
or internet
alter the substrates
for recursive systems,
amplifying their reach
while preserving their logic.
Hector 8.
Implications for Cognition and Language.
Language may be viewed
as a self-perpetuating system,
akin to an autocatalytic set,
or EM wave,
where recursive grammars,
memetic selection,
and cognitive earworms
ensure continuity.
The Zettelkasten method,
recursive AI prompts,
and viral slogans
illustrate this.
Ideas survive
because they replicate,
not because they clarify.
The metaphor of language
as a cognitive infection
is evocative
but risks tautology
as any replicating system,
e.g. gravity chemistry,
could be labeled an infection.
Instead,
we propose that cognition
is an arena
for competing recursive systems
where memes
like the song that doesn't end
persist through
structural stickiness
rather than epistemic merit.
8.1.
Applications of recursive propagation
insights from this framework
can inform practical applications.
Beneficial recursive systems
such as educational memes
or public health campaigns
can leverage stickiness,
e.g. catchy slogans
for vaccination drives
to ensure propagation.
Circuit breakers
for harmful loops
such as algorithmic interventions
to disrupt social media echo chambers
can mitigate recursive amplification.
Knowledge management systems
can evolve beyond Zettelkasten
by balancing persistence
with epistemic rigor,
using structured curation
to filter out epistemic earworms.

Conclusion
Escaping the loop
or listening closely,
self-propagating systems,
whether memes,
waves,
chemical networks,
or social movements,
reveal a unifying principle,
persistence
through recursive structure.
While we may critique such systems
as epistemically hollow,
their elegance lies in their ability
to sustain themselves
across diverse substrates.
The challenge is distinguishing systems
that perpetuate meaning
from those that merely perpetuate themselves.
Recognizing the recursive core
empowers us to navigate their influence,
whether in language, cognition,
or the physical world.
As we hum along
to the song that doesn't end,
we must ask,
are we trapped in a cognitive loop
or are we learning to hear its structure?
