The Song That Doesn't End

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,900
On Recursive Propagation in Memes, Waves, and Autocatalytic Systems

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,940
by Flixion, July 2025.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,140
Abstract

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,280
This essay explores the structural commonality

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,400
underlying seemingly disparate systems.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,080
Viral memes, electromagnetic waves,

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,740
and collectively autocatalytic chemical sets.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,120
Each exhibits self-propagation through internal recursion

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,360
or mutual generation.

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,500
We argue that such systems constitute a general class

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,520
of self-sustaining processes whose continuity is ensured

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,700
not by external validation or utility,

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,380
but by structural features that favor their own persistence.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,820
This analysis situates memetic survival

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,500
within a broader epistemic and physical ontology,

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,980
suggesting that language, cognition, and even physical forces

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,980
participate in a deeper recursive logic,

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,940
extensions to biological, economic, social, and political systems,

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,440
along with empirical and philosophical implications,

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,640
further illuminate this unifying pattern.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,920
One Introduction

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
The Infinite Song

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
The children's tune The Song That Doesn't End

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
encapsulates a recursive loop.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,740
Each line instructs the singer to continue,

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,420
embedding the imperative for perpetuation within its own structure.

31
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,520
Far from a trivial amusement,

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,020
this song exemplifies a broader class of systems,

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,380
memes, electromagnetic waves,

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,320
and autocatalytic chemical sets

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,720
that persist through internal recursion or mutual generation.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,580
Language, often described as a cognitive infection

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,520
that restructures human thought to propagate itself,

38
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,640
serves as a paradigmatic case.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,700
This essay argues that such systems share a structural logic.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,160
They encode instructions or dynamics

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
that ensure their own continuity,

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,440
independent of external truth or utility.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,620
By examining memetic persistence,

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,600
electromagnetic wave propagation,

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,660
autocatalytic chemical networks,

46
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,440
and additional domains like biology and economics,

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,100
we propose a unified framework for self-propagating systems,

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,080
with implications for understanding

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,620
language, cognition, and epistemology.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,360
2. Mimetic persistence and the counterfoil stub

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,200
In memetics, ideas replicate through culture,

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,040
not because they are true or useful,

53
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,700
but because they are replicable.

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,980
Memes that endure often possess qualities

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,300
such as rhythm, emotional salience,

56
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,000
recursion, or self-reference.

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,600
The metaphor of the counterfoil stub,

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,480
a receipt saved because it declares,

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,880
do not throw this away,

60
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,860
captures this dynamic.

61
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,620
Similarly, the Calabari cultural practice

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,500
of offering a counterfoil choice,

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,180
e.g. an empty bowl alongside a full one,

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,740
highlights a preferred option through contrast.

65
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,000
In memetic terms, seemingly inferior or false ideas,

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,700
such as forbidden memes that instruct

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,740
don't share this,

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,360
may persist by leveraging curiosity,

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,420
exclusivity, or social signaling.

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,440
These memes thrive not despite their prohibition,

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
but because it amplifies their allure,

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,960
creating a paradox where disobedience

73
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,060
ensures propagation.

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,100
For example, phrases like,

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

76
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,440
but embed a transgression engine,

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
ensuring their spread through violation

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,340
of their own instructions.

79
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,780
This suggests that memetic survival

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,580
often hinges on structural features,

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,280
stickiness, contrast, or provocation,

82
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,060
rather than epistemic validity.

83
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,500
3. Electromagnetic Waves as Recursive Fields

84
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,460
Electromagnetic EM,

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,820
radiation as described by Maxwell's equations,

86
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,680
exemplifies mutual recursion in physical systems.

87
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,540
A changing electric field induces a magnetic field,

88
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,720
which in turn induces an electric field,

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,840
resulting in a self-propagating wave

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,420
that persists through space

91
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,860
without external intervention.

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,260
This dynamic mirrors memetic loops.

93
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,420
Once initiated,

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,840
the wave structure ensures its continuation,

95
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,420
akin to a meme that regenerates interest

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,940
through responses it elicits.

97
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,800
The recursive interplay of electric and magnetic fields

98
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,500
requires no external validation,

99
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,240
much like a viral slogan

100
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,320
that spreads through its own salience.

101
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,260
This analogy highlights a shared logic,

102
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,560
systems that propagate

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
by generating the conditions

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,140
for their own continuity.

105
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,660
4. Autocatalytic Sets and Chemical Cognition

106
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,340
Stuart Kaufman's theory

107
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,100
of collectively autocatalytic sets

108
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,520
describes chemical systems

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
where molecules catalyze the formation of others

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,060
within the same set,

111
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,420
creating a self-sustaining network.

112
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,800
These sets exhibit structural closure,

113
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,980
requiring no external intervention once initiated,

114
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,780
and propagate by creating favorable conditions

115
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,920
for their own persistence.

116
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,460
Proposed as prebiotic precursors to life,

117
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,480
autocatalytic sets share structural parallels

118
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,440
with memetic networks and language,

119
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,820
where ideas or grammatical rules

120
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,640
mutually reinforce each other.

121
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,260
For instance,

122
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,460
a linguistic system sustains itself

123
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,780
through recursive definitions

124
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,000
and syntactic loops,

125
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,940
much like a chemical network

126
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,080
perpetuates through catalytic cycles.

127
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
This suggests that cognition itself

128
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
may operate as an autocatalytic system,

129
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,740
with ideas persisting through mutual enablement

130
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,280
rather than centralized control.

131
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,160
Here 5. Toward a general theory of self-propagation

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,080
The systems discussed memes, EM-waves,

133
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,100
and autocatalytic sets

134
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,420
share four key criteria.

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,720
1. Recursive causation

136
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,880
Outputs feed back into inputs,

137
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
creating self-reinforcing loops.

138
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,880
2. Mutual generation

139
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,680
Elements produce each other

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,840
across structural boundaries,

141
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,140
as in electric and magnetic fields

142
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,180
or catalytic networks.

143
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,160
3. Persistence

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,740
Through internal logic,

145
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,980
Continuity depends on structural features,

146
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,460
not external validation.

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
4. Resistance determination

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,380
Attempts to halt these systems

149
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,120
often reinforce their propagation,

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
as seen in earworms or forbidden memes.

151
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,240
These criteria define a general class

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,820
of self-propagating systems,

153
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,400
applicable across cognitive,

154
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,600
physical, and chemical domains.

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
For example,

156
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,700
the Zettelkasten note-taking system,

157
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,460
with its interconnected entries,

158
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,860
resembles a memetic autocatalytic set,

159
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,300
where ideas persist through recursive linking

160
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,040
rather than inherent truth.

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,260
5.1. Formalizing recursive propagation

162
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,380
To formalize this framework,

163
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,960
consider recursive causation

164
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
as a dynamical system,

165
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,580
mon d equals un plus dacam,

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,540
where worm represents feedback

167
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,520
from prior states,

168
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,000
modeling loops like those

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,340
in the song that doesn't end.

170
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Resistance determination

171
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,240
can be quantified

172
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,400
via Lyapunov stability,

173
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,040
where a system's fixed points

174
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,400
have negative eigenvalues,

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,160
the A0,

176
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,540
ensuring persistence

177
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,620
against perturbations.

178
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,200
Connections to complexity theory

179
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,620
highlight emergent behavior

180
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,340
in self-organizing systems,

181
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,300
while cybernetics emphasizes

182
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,320
feedback loops,

183
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,360
and systems theory explores

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,680
autopoiesis.

185
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,600
These frameworks provide

186
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,280
rigorous metrics

187
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,900
for analyzing self-propagation,

188
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,420
grounding the essay's

189
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,280
conceptual unity

190
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,080
in mathematical

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,700
and theoretical terms.

192
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,080
5.2. Empirical approaches

193
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,460
to recursive propagation

194
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,540
empirical validation

195
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,300
of this framework

196
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,180
requires testing

197
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,120
the four criteria.

198
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,920
Experiments could measure

199
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,780
memetic persistence

200
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,460
by comparing structural features,

201
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,800
e.g. rhythm-emotional salience,

202
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,080
against truth value,

203
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,920
using metrics like share rates

204
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
or retention time

205
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,040
in social media datasets.

206
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,740
Analysis of viral content

207
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,960
could identify patterns

208
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,760
like recursion or self-reference,

209
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,840
leveraging computational memetics.

210
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,880
Neuroimaging studies

211
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
could explore neural correlates

212
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,080
of earworms,

213
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,300
examining how recursive

214
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,000
cognitive loops

215
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,440
activate reward circuits.

216
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,680
These approaches

217
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,660
would test the hypothesis

218
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,860
that structural features

219
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,700
drive propagation

220
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,960
independent of epistemic merit.

221
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,680
6. Additional domains

222
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,760
of recursive propagation.

223
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,220
6.1. Biological systems.

224
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Viruses, prions, and cancer cells

225
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,500
exhibit recursive propagation.

226
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,520
For example,

227
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,040
viral proteins act as

228
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,180
counterfoil stubs,

229
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,460
ensuring replication

230
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,260
by hijacking cellular machinery.

231
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,800
Prions propagate

232
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,140
by inducing misfolding

233
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,060
in other proteins,

234
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,340
a recursive loop

235
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,620
akin to memetic spread.

236
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,780
Cancer cells sustain growth

237
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,820
through autocatalytic

238
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
signaling pathways,

239
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,560
mirroring the

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
mutual generation criterion.

241
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,940
6.2. Economic systems.

242
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,300
Ponzi schemes

243
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,960
and cryptocurrency hype cycles

244
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,380
operate as autocatalytic

245
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,120
financial loops.

246
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,680
In Ponzi schemes,

247
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,460
early payouts

248
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,800
catalyze further investment,

249
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,100
creating a self-reinforcing cycle

250
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,080
until collapse.

251
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,760
Cryptocurrency markets propagate

252
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
through speculative feedback

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,780
where hype generates more hype,

254
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,640
aligning with the essay's criteria

255
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
of mutual generation

256
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,780
and internal persistence.

257
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,020
6.3. Social media algorithms.

258
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,940
Recommendation algorithms

259
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,800
create recursive content loops

260
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,960
by amplifying attention

261
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
to salient items,

262
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,120
forming echo chambers

263
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,560
that mirror memetic propagation.

264
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,580
These systems exhibit

265
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,900
resistance to termination

266
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,520
as user engagement

267
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
reinforces algorithmic bias,

268
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,040
sustaining loops

269
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,280
without external validation.

270
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,000
6.4. Political movements.

271
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,500
Ideological frameworks,

272
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,180
such as populist narratives,

273
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,680
persist through recursive

274
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,240
reinforcement

275
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,340
and contrastive framing,

276
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,040
e.g. us versus them

277
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,840
as a Calabari counterfoil choice.

278
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,580
These movements propagate

279
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,740
by embedding instructions

280
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,900
for their own continuation,

281
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,460
leveraging emotional salience

282
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,500
and social identity.

283
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,820
7. Philosophical dimensions

284
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,020
of recursive systems.

285
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,780
The recursive framework

286
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,060
raises profound philosophical questions.

287
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,720
The tension between

288
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,780
structural persistence

289
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,960
and epistemic value

290
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,240
challenges traditional notions

291
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,000
of truth-seeking.

292
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,620
If cognition prioritizes

293
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,840
stickiness over validity,

294
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,080
what distinguishes meaningful ideas

295
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
from mere earworms?

296
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,420
This suggests a view of cognition

297
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,960
as an autocatalytic arena

298
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,860
where agency competes

299
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
with recursive loops,

300
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,560
potentially undermining free will.

301
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,700
Connections to Buddhist

302
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,060
dependent origination

303
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,420
where phenomena co-arise

304
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,580
through mutual causation

305
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,060
and Hindu cyclical time,

306
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,640
samsara,

307
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,180
situate the framework

308
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,560
in global philosophical traditions,

309
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,820
highlighting recursion

310
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
as a universal principle

311
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,600
of existence.

312
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,220
7.1. Historical perspectives

313
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,700
on recursive propagation.

314
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,300
Historically,

315
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
recursive systems are evident

316
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,940
in persistent cultural practices.

317
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Oral storytelling traditions

318
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,940
embed recursive structures,

319
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,840
e.g. repeated motifs

320
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,560
in epics that ensure transmission

321
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,660
across generations.

322
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,700
Religious dogmas propagate

323
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,560
through self-referential doctrines

324
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,180
akin to counterfoil stubs.

325
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
Technological shifts

326
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,000
such as the printing press

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,600
or internet

328
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,920
alter the substrates

329
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
for recursive systems,

330
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,260
amplifying their reach

331
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,540
while preserving their logic.

332
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,600
Hector 8.

333
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,920
Implications for Cognition and Language.

334
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,900
Language may be viewed

335
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,540
as a self-perpetuating system,

336
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,360
akin to an autocatalytic set,

337
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
or EM wave,

338
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,140
where recursive grammars,

339
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,020
memetic selection,

340
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,480
and cognitive earworms

341
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,440
ensure continuity.

342
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,280
The Zettelkasten method,

343
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
recursive AI prompts,

344
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,420
and viral slogans

345
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,240
illustrate this.

346
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
Ideas survive

347
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,940
because they replicate,

348
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
not because they clarify.

349
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
The metaphor of language

350
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,620
as a cognitive infection

351
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,060
is evocative

352
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,300
but risks tautology

353
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,760
as any replicating system,

354
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,040
e.g. gravity chemistry,

355
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,780
could be labeled an infection.

356
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,140
Instead,

357
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
we propose that cognition

358
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,280
is an arena

359
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,020
for competing recursive systems

360
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,840
where memes

361
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,060
like the song that doesn't end

362
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,940
persist through

363
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,160
structural stickiness

364
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
rather than epistemic merit.

365
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,220
8.1.

366
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,360
Applications of recursive propagation

367
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,940
insights from this framework

368
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,920
can inform practical applications.

369
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,120
Beneficial recursive systems

370
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
such as educational memes

371
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,880
or public health campaigns

372
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,580
can leverage stickiness,

373
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,500
e.g. catchy slogans

374
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,760
for vaccination drives

375
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,980
to ensure propagation.

376
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,500
Circuit breakers

377
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
for harmful loops

378
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,020
such as algorithmic interventions

379
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,080
to disrupt social media echo chambers

380
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,300
can mitigate recursive amplification.

381
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,500
Knowledge management systems

382
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
can evolve beyond Zettelkasten

383
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,260
by balancing persistence

384
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,340
with epistemic rigor,

385
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
using structured curation

386
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,340
to filter out epistemic earworms.

387
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,400
9.

388
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,080
Conclusion

389
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,400
Escaping the loop

390
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,420
or listening closely,

391
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,200
self-propagating systems,

392
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,960
whether memes,

393
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,540
waves,

394
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,420
chemical networks,

395
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,480
or social movements,

396
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,280
reveal a unifying principle,

397
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,360
persistence

398
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,680
through recursive structure.

399
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,540
While we may critique such systems

400
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,860
as epistemically hollow,

401
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,260
their elegance lies in their ability

402
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,460
to sustain themselves

403
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,980
across diverse substrates.

404
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,100
The challenge is distinguishing systems

405
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,180
that perpetuate meaning

406
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,560
from those that merely perpetuate themselves.

407
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,220
Recognizing the recursive core

408
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,960
empowers us to navigate their influence,

409
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,980
whether in language, cognition,

410
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,220
or the physical world.

411
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,060
As we hum along

412
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,320
to the song that doesn't end,

413
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,920
we must ask,

414
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,800
are we trapped in a cognitive loop

415
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,740
or are we learning to hear its structure?

416
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,840
Let me know if you'd like this

417
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,040
formatted into a document,

418
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,120
turned into a summary,

419
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,580
or transformed into slides.
