1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They walk among us in disguise

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,740
Fake names and faces spreading lies

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,380
In the digital crowds they skate

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,100
Masters of a phantom base

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Who's real and who's a masquerade

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,160
In this wild book parade

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,100
We spin around till the truth bends

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,900
Can you spot your real friends?

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,100
Hiding in virtual shape

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,100
A perfect storm they've made

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Questions stir inside our head

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,100
Is this life or algorithm fed?

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,100
Who's real and who's a masquerade

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,160
In this wild book parade

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,160
We spin around till the truth bends

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Can you spot your real friends?

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,160
They speak in scripted code so tight

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Unseen in the dead of night

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Unmask them if you dare

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Yet they vanish in thinner

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Who's real and who's a masquerade

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Who's real and who's a masquerade

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
In this wild book parade

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
We spin around till the truth bends

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Can you spot your real friends?

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Who's real and who's a masquerade

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
In this wild book parade

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
We spin around till the truth bends

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Can you spot your real friends?

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Can you spot your real friends?

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Can you spot your real friends?

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Who's real and who's a masquerade

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Who's real and who's a masquerade

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Who's real and who's a masquerade

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
In this wild book parade

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,540
Turn around till the truth ends

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,980
Can you spot your real friends?

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
Can you spot your real friends?

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,460
You spin around till the truth ends

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,620
Can you spot your real friends?

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Your friends

42
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,960
Your friends

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,660
Your real friends

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,820
Yeah
