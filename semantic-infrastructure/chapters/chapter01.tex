\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Modern software development platforms, such as GitHub, are constrained by syntactic limitations that obstruct meaningful collaboration. Symbolic namespaces cause collisions, version control prioritizes textual diffs over conceptual coherence, merges resolve syntactic conflicts without semantic awareness, and forks fragment epistemic lineages. This monograph constructs a semantic, compositional, entropy-respecting framework, grounded in mathematical physics, higher category theory, and sheaf theory, to redefine computation as structured flows of meaning.

The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory models computation as dynamic interactions of scalar coherence fields $\Phi$, vector inference flows $\vec{v}$, and entropy fields $S$ over a spacetime manifold $M = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ with Minkowski metric $g_{\mu\nu} = \text{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$. Semantic modules are localized condensates of meaning, integrated through thermodynamic, categorical, and topological consistency. The framework leverages higher category theory for modularity, sheaf theory for coherence, obstruction theory for mergeability, homotopy theory for higher merges, and type theory for implementation. This section outlines the monograph’s structure, with Chapters 1–14 developing the framework and Appendices A–G providing technical foundations, proofs, and diagrams.
